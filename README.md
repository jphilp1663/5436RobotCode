# 5436RobotCode
All of our lovely robot code collected over the years.

Please take note of a few things, some of these files have never been deployed onto the field and may not even work if downloaded
and put onto a robot.

The basic drive train is a twin full cim on both sides with six wheels belt driven on both sides.

All systems have encoders built into drive system, not all have encoder failure failsafe.

None of the interfaces are included but will be later if you ask for them.

Contact me at anytime if you need help with anything as the person who wrote this code is no longer on the team.
